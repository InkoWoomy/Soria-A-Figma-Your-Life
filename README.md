This project contains a small portfolio of who I am and what my interests are, as well as what accomplishments I have done so far. There are 3 pages which separate each category, which includes all this info, as well as some images and backgrounds to make it pop.

Peer Review: Nolan Parker
The file seems to run good and the layout is really nice and I have no real issues with it and good job using some of the layouts in Bootstrap.
